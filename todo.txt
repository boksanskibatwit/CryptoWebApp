### 1 **Add Persistent Storage (Database)**

unsabel to view messages on relog

### 2. **Add Security Best Practices for Web Deployment**

* Your essay mentions securing against XSS, session hijacking, etc.
* Current Flask app is wide open and basic â€” you should:

  * Force HTTPS (e.g., behind nginx with TLS cert)
  * Use secure session tokens (e.g., JWT or cookie-based auth if you expand)
  * Sanitize frontend inputs (basic XSS protection)
  * Disable debug mode in production

### Bonus Improvements (Optional)

* Add timestamps to messages
* Add logout button (just clears state on frontend)
