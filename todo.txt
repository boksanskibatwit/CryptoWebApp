### 1 **Add Persistent Storage (Database or Flat File)**

* Currently using in-memory Python dictionaries (`users`, `messages`, etc.), which are lost on server restart.
* Add SQLite or a simple file-based system to store:

  * Users + password hashes
  * Public keys
  * Encrypted messages

### 2. **Add Security Best Practices for Web Deployment**

* Your essay mentions securing against XSS, session hijacking, etc.
* Current Flask app is wide open and basic â€” you should:

  * Force HTTPS (e.g., behind nginx with TLS cert)
  * Use secure session tokens (e.g., JWT or cookie-based auth if you expand)
  * Sanitize frontend inputs (basic XSS protection)
  * Disable debug mode in production

### Bonus Improvements (Optional)

* Add timestamps to messages
* Add logout button (just clears state on frontend)
* Show message history instead of clearing it on refresh
